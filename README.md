ðŸ¥” Python in Maya Done With a Sweet Potato ðŸ¥”
===========================================

Yama is a wrapper for `maya.cmds` and `maya.api.OpenMaya`, with consistent object-oriented behavior in relation to maya nodes.

Very similar and very inspired by pymel and cmdx.

Yama is mostly a fancy way for me to store my maya scripts, and a playground to allow fast scripting work how I like it.
